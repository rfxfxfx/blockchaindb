# BlockchainDB

**A self-hosted blockchain database with a Supabase-like dashboard.**

> The blockchain is your database.

Clone the repo, deploy one smart contract, open `localhost:3000`, and manage your
blockchain database from a beautiful dashboard. Your data lives inside a smart
contract — collections of JSON documents with auto-incrementing IDs — on a
**real EVM network** of your choice. Default: **Polygon Amoy** testnet; switch
to any preset testnet/mainnet (or a custom RPC) from the Settings page. No
Solidity knowledge required.

## Deploy your own

> Replace `YOUR_GH_USERNAME/blockchaindb` with your repo, then use these buttons
> (they're also on the in-app **API** page):

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/YOUR_GH_USERNAME/blockchaindb&env=RPC_URL,PRIVATE_KEY,CONTRACT_ADDRESS,API_KEY)
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/YOUR_GH_USERNAME/blockchaindb)

Set `RPC_URL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`, and (optional) `API_KEY` when
the host prompts. **Note:** serverless hosts (Vercel/Netlify) have a read-only
filesystem, so the in-app Settings/Deploy/API-key writes don't persist there —
configure via the host's environment variables instead (deploy your contract
locally first with `npm run deploy`, then set `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`). The API and
dashboard read from env vars and work fully.

## Quick Start (the 5-minute tutorial)

**Step 1 — Clone the repository.**

```bash
git clone <this-repo> && cd blockchaindb
```

**Step 2 — Install dependencies.**

```bash
npm install
```

**Step 3 — Start the app.**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> — the app connects to **Polygon Amoy** by default.

**Step 4 — Open ⚙️ Settings** and:
1. Pick a network (testnet/mainnet tabs, or a custom RPC). Amoy is preselected.
2. Paste a **wallet private key** funded on that network. For Amoy, grab free
   test POL from the faucet linked right there in Settings.
3. Click **Deploy Database.sol** — the contract deploys from your wallet and
   the address is filled in and saved automatically.

*(Prefer the CLI? Set `RPC_URL` + `PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env.local` and run
`npm run deploy` — it deploys and writes `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` back for you.)*

**Step 5 — Create your first collection.** e.g. `Users`.

**Step 6 — Create your first document.**

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 20
}
```

**Step 7 — View, edit, delete, and browse** your blockchain database from the
dashboard. Every save is a transaction on the real chain; every read comes
straight off it.

## Networks

Preset chains, selectable in Settings (Polygon Amoy is always the default):

- **Testnets:** Polygon Amoy · Ethereum Sepolia · Base Sepolia · Arbitrum
  Sepolia · OP Sepolia · BNB Testnet · Avalanche Fuji — each with a faucet link
- **Mainnets:** Polygon · Ethereum · Base · Arbitrum One · OP Mainnet ·
  BNB Chain · Avalanche C-Chain (with a "real funds" warning)
- **Custom RPC:** any other EVM-compatible endpoint

Contract addresses are per-network: switching chains means deploying (or
pasting) a Database contract on that chain.

## Dashboard

- 🏠 **Dashboard** — stats (collections, documents, network, contract, latest tx, status) and recent documents
- 📁 **Collections** — browse and create collections
- 📄 **Documents** — data table + JSON document editor (create / edit / delete)
- 🌐 **Network** — chain, block height, RPC, wallet, balance, testnet/mainnet, faucet, explorer
- 📜 **Smart Contract** — address, owner, current block, full interface
- ⚙️ **Settings** — network picker, wallet key, contract address, one-click deploy → saved to `.env.local`

## Data Model

```
Database → Collections → Documents → fields (encrypted on-chain)
```

Every document gets an auto-incrementing ID (starting at 1) plus
`createdAt` / `updatedAt` timestamps from the block. You build documents with a
**Supabase-style field editor** (plain-text fields with a Text / Number /
Boolean type — no JSON to hand-write). A "raw JSON" toggle is there for nested
data and power users.

## Encryption (private by default)

A public blockchain means anyone can read transaction data. BlockchainDB
**encrypts every document payload before it's written on-chain** with
AES-256-GCM, keyed from your wallet's private key — so the ledger only stores an
opaque blob and **only the key owner can read it back**.

```
on-chain value:  enc:v1:<base64( iv | authTag | ciphertext )>
```

- The key is derived from `PRIVATE_KEY` (scrypt); it never leaves the server and
  is never sent to the browser. A read-only viewer without the key sees only
  ciphertext.
- Documents written before encryption (or by other tools) stay readable —
  anything without the `enc:v1:` prefix is treated as plaintext.
- **Note:** this is real *encryption*, not a hash. A SHA-256 hash is one-way and
  could never be read back; AES-GCM is reversible with the key and also detects
  tampering.
- Because the key comes from your wallet key, **rotating your wallet makes older
  encrypted documents unreadable.** Keep the key that wrote the data.

Collection *names* are still stored as plaintext labels (they're schema, like
table names); if you need those hidden too, use opaque names.

## CRUD API

| Endpoint | Method | Body / query |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/create` | POST | `{ "collection": "users", "data": { … } }` |
| `/api/get` | GET | `?collection=users&id=1` |
| `/api/update` | POST | `{ "collection": "users", "id": 1, "data": { … } }` |
| `/api/delete` | POST | `{ "collection": "users", "id": 1 }` |
| `/api/list` | GET | `?collection=users` |
| `/api/collections` | GET / POST | — / `{ "name": "users" }` |
| `/api/health` | GET | safe public status (network, contract, counts) |
| `/api/status` | GET | full snapshot incl. wallet/balance (dashboard) |
| `/api/deploy` | POST | `{ "confirm": true }` — deploy (dashboard only) |

All data endpoints accept an optional `x-api-key` header (see
[Using it as an API](#using-it-as-an-api-back-any-website)) and send CORS
headers. `/api/settings`, `/api/deploy`, `/api/apikey` are dashboard-only.

## Using it as an API (back any website)

BlockchainDB is a REST API you can point a real website or server at.

1. **CORS is enabled** on all data endpoints, so a browser app on any origin can
   call them.
2. **Auth is an optional API key.** With no key set the API is *open* (fine for
   local dev). Generate a key from the dashboard's **API** page (or set
   `API_KEY` in `.env.local`) and every external call must then send it:

   ```
   x-api-key: bdb_…            (or)   Authorization: Bearer bdb_…
   ```

   The dashboard itself never needs the key (it's recognised as same-origin).
   Admin endpoints (`/api/settings`, `/api/deploy`, `/api/apikey`) are always
   dashboard-only.
3. **Deploy** this Next.js app anywhere (Vercel, a VPS, …) and use that public
   URL as your API base.

Minimal client:

```js
const BASE = "https://your-instance.example.com";
const KEY  = "bdb_…"; // omit the header if your instance is open

const db = (path, opts = {}) =>
  fetch(BASE + path, {
    ...opts,
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", "x-api-key": KEY },
  }).then((r) => r.json());

await db("/api/create", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ collection: "guestbook", data: { name: "Ada", message: "hi" } }),
});
const { documents } = await db("/api/list?collection=guestbook");
```

A complete, ready-to-open example — a guestbook website with full CRUD — is in
[`examples/basic-crud-site.html`](examples/basic-crud-site.html). Open it in a
browser, point it at your instance (and paste an API key if it needs one), and
it works. `GET /api/health` returns a safe status (network, contract, counts)
for consumers to check.

> Reads return **decrypted** data, so protect the API with a key before exposing
> it — otherwise anyone who can reach it can read your plaintext and spend your
> wallet's gas on writes.

## SDK

`lib/database.ts` exports the same operations as a TypeScript class (used by
the API routes; usable from any server-side code):

```ts
const db = new BlockchainDB();

const { id } = await db.create("users", { name: "John", age: 25 });
await db.get("users", id);
await db.update("users", id, { age: 26 });
await db.list("users");
await db.delete("users", id);
```

## Smart Contract

One contract only: `contracts/Database.sol`, with `create`, `get`, `update`,
`remove` (delete is a reserved word in Solidity), `list`, plus
`createCollection`, `listCollections` and `totalDocuments` for the dashboard.
Writes are `onlyOwner` — the wallet that deployed it owns the database.

The compiled artifact ships in `abi/Database.json`. If you edit the contract,
recompile with `npm run compile` (plain solc — no framework) and redeploy.

## Environment Variables

```
RPC_URL=            # defaults to https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
PRIVATE_KEY=        # wallet that owns the contract (signs every write)
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=   # filled by deploy (Settings button or npm run deploy)
```

All three are managed for you by the Settings page.

## Landing page

The `/` route is a scroll-scrubbed "fly through the crypto world" cinematic
built with [scroll-world](https://github.com/0xrlawrence/scroll-world): scroll
drives a pre-rendered camera flight through five isometric crypto scenes
(the chain → consensus → smart contracts → the vault → the studio) with
frame-identical seams. The scrub engine is `public/scroll-world/scrub-engine.js`;
scene clips and stills live in `public/scroll-world/assets/`; the generator
pipeline is in `tools/landing-gen/`.
